This project was part of the Modern Control Theory (MCT) course which was my first elective in Chemical Engineering department. The course content included state space modelling, controllabilty and observability of linear systems and, discretization and linearization of nonlinear systems. Then the course moved into Kalman filters, EKF, Uncertain Kalman filters and other variations of kalman filters. Later, Model predictive control design and, modelling & tuning of parameters was discussed. The project was mainly aimed at implementing the theoretical concepts on nonlinear FCC atomic model using MATLAB ODE Suite. MPC was implemented with MATLAB fmincon optimization function and effects of changes in initial value, control & prediction horizon, EKF state estimator parameters were analyzed and reported. EKF state estimation and Model predictive controller design for nonlinear FCC model was split into two parts.
