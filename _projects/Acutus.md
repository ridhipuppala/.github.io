*Acutus* is a hybrid robot which can fly in air and also navigate underwater. It is a remotely operated underwater vehicle with a streamlined fish-like outer profile and uses the conventional quadrotor configuration for aerial traversal. *Acutus* switches between quadcopter and fish morphology using minimal actuation. Major contribution is the significant reduction in hydrodynamic drag compared to existing systems.

## My contribution

The work is a team effort of four undergraduate students supervised by a PhD scholar and Professor. After several iterations of ideations, we all agreed upon a fish shaped reconfigurable quadrotor system. I was partially involved with design of the mechanisms, outer profile and casings, clamps, control planes and the fabrication process. I extensively worked on estimating the rigid body (inertial) and added mass, coriolis & centripetal, hydrodynamic damping parameters using computational system identification method. Fluent (ANSYS CFD) tool was used for estimating drag parameters and Fusion 360 for CAD modelling. Using Newton-Euler formulation I modelled underwater and aerial dynamics and presented a unified framework for overall dynamics including transition dynamics. The developed prototype was tested to succesfully validate the concept. My contribution was relatively higher than other members.

## Euro Trip

I presented my paper at ICINCO 2019 in Prague Czechia during July 29-31 2019. It was my first trip to Europe and maiden experience of presenting research paper at academic conference. Detours to Venice, Budapest, Cesky Krumlov from Prague were the most exciting part of the Euro trip.
