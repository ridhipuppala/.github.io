In this project, self winding mechanism was designed and analyzed using theoretical design calculations techniques taught in the course. A detailed CAD model of the complete mechanism was designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 and FEA analysis was performed to validate our design calculations. FEA add-on in Fusion 360 was used for structural analysis. Our watch consisted of jewel bearings, shafts, gears and wheels and eccentric mass. We increased self-winding efficiency of watch by more 90% by introducing double ratcheted winding mechanism driven by eccentric mass. Detailed presentation can be found [here](/assets/dome_ppt.pdf). The followingimage shows the CAD assembly of complete mechanism.
