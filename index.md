I am Ridhi Puppala, a final year student at Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) pursuing an Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Robotics program (B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and M.Tech in Robotics). Over the years at IIT Madras, I have developed a deep interest towards Robotics, Controls, Vision, Machine Learning and related areas.

**Here's a list of areas that fascinate me:**

* Broad theortical areas: Robotics, Control theory, Systems theory, Computer Vision, Convex Optimization, Machine Learning, Algorithms
* Specific areas: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning for Vision, Nonsmooth dynamical analsysis, Graph theory, Algorithms in Perception and Planning, Motion Planning, Trajectory generation, Adaptive Control, State Estimation, Sensor Fusion
* Application areas: Mobile Robots (Ground, Aerial, Underwater), Multi-robot and Networked Systems, Autonomous Systems, Driverless Cars, Field and Service Robots, Guidance and Navigation for autonmous systems

To summarize, I love to solving fundamental problems in Robotics and Interlligent/autonomous systems using theortical concepts and other mathematical tools. I am not only restricted to theory, but also actively implement and validate algorithms that forge autonomy, intelligence and self-sufficiency in robots. I have extensively used simulations and physical experiments in the field of robotics and controls. Extensive engagment with Robotics through academic coursework, projects, internships, research and co-curricular activities have motivated me to pursue a career in Robotics. 

**I am actively looking for opportunities in the fields of Robotics, Computer Vision, Automatic Control, Machine Learning and other relate areas. I am open to positions as an Engineering, R&D or Research roles in the above specified fields.**
