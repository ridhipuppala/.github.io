I am Ridhi Puppala, a final year student at Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) pursuing an Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Robotics program (B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and M.Tech in Robotics). Over the years at IIT Madras, I have developed a deep interest towards Robotics and Control theory. 

Acutus, a hybrid aerial-underwater robot was my first experience of research. Design optimization and performance evaluvation of RoBuoy - underwater glider was my next undergraduate research project at Robotics Lab, IIT Madras. Both of these research projects were advised by [Prof. Asokan Thondiyath](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~asokan/). During the summer of 2019, I was a research intern at The Autonomous Robots and Multi-robot Systems Lab (ARMS Lab) , IIT Bombay supervised by [Prof. Leena Vachhani](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~leena/). I developed a simple yet efficient reactive controller for global navigation using minimal sensor information by exploiting concepts of nonlinear systems, sliding mode control, geometry and perception. Currently, I am working on my Master's thesis on the topic of Distributed coordination, control and stabilization for fomations of multi robot systems at the Dynamics and Control Lab situated in Electrical Engineering department of IIT Madras. Thesis is supervised by [Prof. Arun D. Mahindrakar](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~arun_dm/). Particularly, I am trying to develop a unified framework to include features like connectivity, collision avoidance, robusteness against communication failures or agent deregistration, formation stabilization under practical comminication and sensor constraints  in Multi robot formations.

**Here's a list of research topics that fascinate me:**

* Multi-agent/robot systems, Autonomous and intelligent robots, Hybrid Systems
* Distributed coordination, localization, coverage control for networked systems
* Reactive navigation, Motion and Path Planning, Perception for autonomy 
* Design, System Modelling, Controller synthesis for robots (Aerial, Marine and Ground)

To summarize, I love to solve fundamental research problems in Robotics using concepts of nonlinear systems, control theory and mathematics by employing rigororous methods for proving solutions. Academic coursework, abundant research experience and extensive involvement with co-curricular robotics activities have motivated me to pursue graduate study and research after my graduation from IIT Madras.
